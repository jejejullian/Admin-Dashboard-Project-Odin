## 📁 Project Overview
The Admin Dashboard project focuses on applying **CSS Grid** and **semantic HTML** to recreate a full dashboard layout. This project also includes usage of SCSS for modular styling and Material Design Icons (MDI) for visual elements.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Build complex layouts using **CSS Grid**.
- Apply **modular SCSS** to organize style rules.
- Use **Material Design Icons** for UI components.
- Improve understanding of HTML structure with semantic elements.

---

## 📐 Layout Structure
The layout consists of:

- **Sidebar** with navigation and logo.
- **Header** with search, user info, and notification controls.
- **Main content** divided into:
  - Projects (cards/grid)
  - Announcements (list style)
  - Trending (user activities)

SCSS uses BEM naming convention and is split into partials for scalability.
